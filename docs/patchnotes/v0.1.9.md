**Appendix:**
By default, the search icons will both be visible at the same time and overlap. To switch this, you'll have to change their behavior in the style sheet. Something like this will work: 
```css
#search-icon-holder image {
    transition: 0.1s ease;
}
#search-icon-holder.search image:nth-child(1){
    opacity: 1;
}
#search-icon-holder.search image:nth-child(2){
    opacity: 0;
}
#search-icon-holder.back image:nth-child(1){
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-10px);
}
#search-icon-holder.back image:nth-child(2){
    opacity: 1;
}

```
