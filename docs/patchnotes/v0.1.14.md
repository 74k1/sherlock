### Deprecated Fallback Keys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have deprecated some keys in the fallback file. `only_home` and `home` are
> not combined in the home key with the following values: `"Home" (default)`,
> `"OnlyHome"`, and `"Search"`

### Pomodoro Timer

Sherlock now has a pomodoro timer. This is a launcher depending on another
binary, which can be downloaded [here](). This binary handles the timer in the
background so that sherlock does not have to stay running. The
sherlock-pomodoro program sits at about 1.9M ram usage and is dormant for most
of the time. This makes it use extremly few resources.
