## ‚ú® FEATURES

### Deprecated Fallback Keys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have deprecated some keys in the fallback file. `only_home` and `home` are
> not combined in the home key with the following values: `"Home"`,
> `"OnlyHome"`, and `"Search" (default)`

### Pomodoro Timer

Sherlock now has a pomodoro timer. This is a launcher depending on another
binary, which can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock-pomodoro). This binary handles the
timer in the background so that Sherlock does not have to stay running. The
sherlock-pomodoro program sits at about 1.9M ram usage and is dormant for most
of the time. This makes it use extremely few resources.

### Custom Binds and Inner Functions

This new feature allows users to create custom binds for launchers. Some
launchers will provide "inner functions" which can be bound to custom keys via
the their related `binds` section in the `fallback.json` file. These functions
can also be used in the actions to be used in conjunction with the context
menu. You can refer to the pomodoro-tile in the
[launchers.md](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/launchers.md)
file where this is demonstrated.
