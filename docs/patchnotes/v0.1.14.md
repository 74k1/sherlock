## ✨ FEATURES

### Pomodoro Timer

Sherlock now has a pomodoro timer. This is a launcher depending on another binary, which can be downloaded [here](). This binary handles the timer in the background so that sherlock does not have to stay running. The sherlock-pomodoro program sits at about 1.9M ram usage and is dormant for most of the time. This makes it use extremly few resources.
