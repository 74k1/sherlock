## ✨ FEATURES:

### Minor Features
- Added new option to recolor icons. You can now use the `icon_class` field in commands to add the css class to that icon. You can then style it using `-gtk-icon-filter: brightness(0) saturate(100%) contrast(100%); /* black */`.
- Added a new themes section [here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/tree/main/themes). Feel free to use or modify them to your needs.
- In daemonize mode, you can now just run Sherlock again to open the window instead of sending the message directly to the socket.
