**Minor Changes:**
- IMPROVEMENT: Changed the async widget body to be a GTKLabel instead of GTKTextView. Also added default text "Loading..." for the corresponding "Loader Widget".

each launcher has children - tiles that can hold different properties depending on the type of launcher. A launchers have variable amount of children. 
based on a search string, that every tile has, it will be either shown in the search screen or not.
