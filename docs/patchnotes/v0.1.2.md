Changes Made:
- Fixed flag loader. Previously the only the default flags (--version, --help) worked. Now the custom ones work too.
- Implemented error handling for config loader and css loader
- FOUND ERROR where warning wouldnt show traceback of its the only tile in the error view <- Fixed by using label instead of textview
- Code refactoring
